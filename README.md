# [Isochronous-Cyclotron](https://github.com/TonyAlarcon/Isochronous-Cyclotron/blob/master/Isochronous_cyclotron.py)

```
Cyclotron and isochronous cyclotron particle accelerator sumilations. Implemented object-oriented methodology to resemble
subatomic particles and utilized the Runge-Kutta 4th order integration algorithm to solve electromagnetic differential 
equations and gather data of interest. Dynamic attribute updates allowed the model to accurately resemble relativistic
principles and effects.
